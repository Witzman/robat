# RoBat Robot Construction Kit #

RoBat is a great robot kit with which you can build your own robot. It's not hard at all and you can design your robot according to your ideas. The instructions explain how to use the kit.

With these instructions we build together a moving robot. You can either control it yourself with a small joystick or let it find its own way.

In contrast to many other robot kits, Robat does not have a specified chassis. On the one hand, this would make it easier to set up, but on the other hand it would limit the possibilities. With a piece of sturdy cardboard and a hot glue gun you can easily build your own chassis.

You will find full instructions here in a few weeks.

Have fun!
